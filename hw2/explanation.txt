The flow program is designed to create flexible command workflows by combining simple Unix commands. At its core, the program uses three main structures: Node, PipeNode, and Concatenate. A Node represents a single command, storing its name and the shell command to be executed. When running a node, the program uses fork() to create a child process and execlp() to execute the command, allowing any shell command to be run as a separate entity. PipeNodes connect two nodes, mimicking Unix pipes. To implement this, the program creates two child processes: one for the 'from' command that writes its output to a pipe, and another for the 'to' command that reads from this pipe as its input. This setup allows for chaining commands, with the output of one feeding into the input of another. The Concatenate structure enables sequential execution of multiple nodes or pipes. It builds a single shell command by joining all parts with semicolons, then executes this combined command as if it were a single node.

The program's workflow begins by parsing a flow file, which defines the nodes, pipes, and concatenations. It stores these in separate arrays for easy access and management. The main function takes two arguments: the flow file and an action to execute (which can be a node, pipe, or concatenation name). It then identifies the requested action and executes it using the appropriate method. This design allows for great flexibility in creating complex command workflows. One of the main challenges in implementing this system was handling the different types of actions and ensuring proper process management. The program uses careful error handling and proper closing of file descriptors to maintain reliability, especially in complex flows. Another challenge was designing a parsing system that could accurately interpret the flow file and create the corresponding structures. The solution involved a systematic approach to reading the file line by line and populating the appropriate data structures. Overall, this implementation provides a powerful tool for users to create intricate command pipelines using simple, building-block-like components, all defined in an easy-to-read flow file format.

The flow program's functionality is verified through a series of test cases, each designed to test different aspects of the system. Test-1 checks the basic pipe functionality by listing files and counting them, mimicking the 'ls | wc' command. This ensures that simple pipes between two nodes work correctly. Test-2 examines the program's ability to handle text transformation by converting text to uppercase, similar to using 'tr' in a Unix command. Test-3 and Test-4 use a more complex flow file (complicated.flow) to test concatenation and nested operations. Test-3 verifies that the program can execute a sequence of commands, including both direct output and piped transformations. Test-4 builds on this by adding an additional piping operation, checking if the program can handle more intricate command chains.
Tests 5-7 use a comprehensive flow file to examine various aspects of data processing. Test-5 focuses on number operations, including generating, sorting, summing, and multiplying numbers. This test ensures that the program can handle multiple mathematical operations in a single flow. Test-6 tests word operations, including generating words, counting their occurrences, and converting them to uppercase. This verifies the program's text processing capabilities. Finally, Test-7 checks a specific pipe operation for reverse-sorting numbers, confirming that individual pipes within a more complex flow file can be executed independently. Together, these tests provide a thorough examination of the flow program's capabilities, from simple pipes to complex data processing workflows, ensuring reliability across various use cases.
